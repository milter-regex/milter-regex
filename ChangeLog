3.1: January 15th, 2023
Output country code to log messages

3.0: April 23rd, 2022
Takao Abe added GeoIP filtering criteria, you can find his version on github.com/milter-regex.

2.7: December 12th, 2019
Add -t option to test the configuration file and exit with a status, suggested by Ralph Seichter.

2.6: April 26th, 2019
Treat socket file name without prefix like local file, from Takao Abe. Make pid file writable
only by root, from Ralph Seichter.

2.5: April 18th, 2019
Add -r option to write pid file. Based on FreeBSD port patches.

2.4: March 2nd, 2019
Add -f option to set syslog facility. Patch from Takao Abe.

2.3: January 28th, 2019
Bug fix: for actions followed by multiple expressions (not just one arbitrarily complex expression),
when multiple expressions become defined during the same sequence point, but with different values
(e.g. one true, another false), depending on the expression order, the action might not be taken,
 when it should be.
This affects all prior versions since 1.0. As a workaround, use only a single expression per action
(duplicating action lines where needed), or combine multiple expressions to a single expression
per action using 'or'.
Report and testing by JCA.

2.2: September 25, 2018
Add -U, -G, and -P options to set pipe user, group, and permissions. Suggested and tested by Ralph Seichter.

2.1: September 26, 2017
Default maximum log level to 6 (LOG_INFO), i.e. exclude LOG_DEBUG.

2.0: November 25, 2013
Add -l option to specify maximum log level.

1.9: November 21, 2011
Add -j option to chroot. Improve building on various platforms. Fix some typos in documentation
 and example config.

1.8: August 12, 2010
Log symbolic host name together with numeric IP address.

1.7: August 4, 2007
Support filtering sendmail macros, like {auth_type}.

1.6: June 6, 2005
Support sendmail quarantine action. Requires non-ancient sendmail (>= 8.13) and libmilter,
as shipping with recent *BSD releases by default.
More fixes for the state machine, dealing with multi-message connections.

1.5: March 19, 2004
Fix logic errors in dealing with multi-message connections (SMTP RSET, HELO or MAIL FROM resetting
SMTP state). Add cb_abort callback.

1.4: March 13, 2004
Some performance improvements, abort rule evaluation immediately when no further rules can possibly match.
 Compile without -Werror, as some ports generate warnings.

1.3: March 8, 2004
Two bugfixes related to RCPT TO: rule evaluation (DSN options and multiple receipients would match
incorrectly), umask(0177) for pipe, fix for Solaris daemon() implementation. Improved logging
(From:, To: and Subject: headers, when available).

1.2: February 27, 2004
Some logging improvements and small fixes. Adds Makefiles for GNU/Linux and Solaris.
Thanks to everyone who helped me solve the build problems.

1.1: February 25, 2004
Support macro definition/expansion.

1.0: February 24, 2004
Now supports boolean expressions, so multiple regular expressions can be combined using
and, or, not and parentheses.
Note that the new parser now requires quotes around reject/tempfail messages.
If you get syntax errors in your existing configuration file, lacking quotes are a likely cause.
Otherwise rulesets are backwards compatible with pre-1.0 versions.

0.1: September 24, 2003
First version.
