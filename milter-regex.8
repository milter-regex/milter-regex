.Sh NAME
.Nm milter-regex
.Nd sendmail milter plugin for regular expression filtering
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl c Ar config
.Op Fl f Ar facility
.Op Fl j Ar dirname
.Op Fl l Ar loglevel
.Op Fl m Ar number
.Op Fl p Ar pipe
.Op Fl r Ar pid-file
.Op Fl t
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Op Fl G Ar group
.Op Fl P Ar mode
.Op Fl U Ar user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
plugin can be used with the milter API of
.Xr sendmail 8
to filter mails using regular expressions matching SMTP envelope
parameters and mail headers and body.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-c config"
.It Fl d
Don't detach from controlling terminal and produce verbose debug
output on stdout.
.It Fl c Ar config
Use the specified configuration file instead of the default,
/etc/milter-regex.conf.
.It Fl f Ar facility
Use the specified syslog facility instead of the default, daemon.
.It Fl j Ar dirname
Change root to the specified directory.
.It Fl l Ar loglevel
Only log messages up to and including the specified level.
See
.Xr syslog 3
for the numerical values, e.g. the default LOG_INFO=6.
.It Fl m Ar number
Ignore mail body after the specified number of lines.
.It Fl p Ar pipe
Use the specified pipe to interface
.Xr sendmail 8 .
Default is unix:/var/spool/milter-regex/sock.
.It Fl r Ar pid-file
Write the pid to the specified file. Default is not to write a file.
.It Fl t
Test the configuration file and immediately exit with a status
indicating whether the file is valid.
.It Fl u Ar user
Run as the specified user instead of the default, _milter-regex.
When
.Nm
is started as root, it calls
.Xr setuid 2
to drop privileges.
The non-privileged user should have read access to the configuration
file and read-write access to the pipe.
.It Fl G Ar group
Set the group ID of the pipe.
.It Fl P Ar mode
Set the permissions of the pipe to the specified mode instead of the default,
0600.
.It Fl U Ar user
Set the user ID of the pipe.
.El
.Pp
.Sh SENDMAIL CONFIGURATION
The plugin needs to be registered in the
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration, by adding the following lines to the .mc file
.Bd -literal -offset indent
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`milter-regex',
	`S=unix:/var/spool/milter-regex/sock, T=S:30s;R:2m')
.Ed
.Pp
rebuilding /etc/mail/sendmail.cf from the .mc file using
.Xr m4 1 ,
and restarting
.Xr sendmail 8 .
.Pp
.Sh PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
The configuration file consists of rules that, when matched, cause
.Xr sendmail 8
to reject mails.
Emtpy lines and lines starting with # are ignored, as well as
leading whitespace (blanks, tabs).
Trailing backslashes can be used to wrap long rules into multiple
lines.
Each rule starts with one of the following commands:
.Bl -tag -width "xxxx"
.It reject <message>
Subsequent rules cause the mail to be rejected with a permanent
error consisting of the specified text part.
The SMTP reply consists of the three-digit code 554 (RFC 2821
"command rejected for policy reasons"), the extended reply code
5.7.1 (RFC 1893 "Permanent Failure", "Security or Policy Status",
"Delivery not authorized, message refused") and the text part
(which defaults to "Command rejected", if not specified).
This is a permanent failure, which causes the sender to remove the
message from its queue without trying to retransmit, commonly
generating a bounce message to the sender.
.It tempfail <message>
Subsequent matching rules cause the mail to be rejected with
a temporary error consisting of the specified text part.
The SMTP reply consists of the three-digit code 451 (RFC 2821
"Requested action aborted: local error in processing"), the extended
reply code 4.7.1 (RFC 1893 "Persistent Transient Failure",
"Security or Policy Status", "Delivery not authorized, message refused")
and the text part (which defaults to "Please try again later",
if not specified).
This is a temporary failure, which causes the sender to keep the
message in its queue and try to retransmit it, commonly for several
days.
.It discard
Subsequent matching rules cause the mail to be accepted but then
discarded silently.
Note that
.Em connect
and
.Em helo
rules should not use
.Em discard .
.It quarantine <message>
Subsequent matching rules cause the mail to be quarantined in
.Xr sendmail 8 .
.It accept
Subsequent matching rules cause the mail to be accepted without
further rule evaluation.
Can be used for whitelist criteria.
.El
.Pp
A command is followed by one or more expressions, each causing
the previous command to be executed when matched.
The following expressions can be used:
.Bl -tag -width "xxxx"
.It connect <hostname> <address>
Reject the connection if both the sender's hostname and address
match the specified regular expressions.
The numerical address is either dotted-quad (IPv4) or coloned-hex (IPv6).
The hostname is the result of a DNS reverse resolution of the numerical
address (which
.Xr sendmail 8
performs independantly of the milter plugin).
When resolution fails, the hostname contains the numerical
address in square brackets.
.It country <code>
The sender's country code is get from the sender's IP address by
looking at the RIR's address allocation lists.
.br
The sender's country code is checked matching with the specified country code.
.It helo <name>
Reject the connection if the sender supplied HELO name matches
the specified regular expression.
Commonly, the sender supplies his fully-qualified hostname as
HELO name.
.It envfrom <address>
Reject the mail if the sender supplied envelope MAIL FROM
address matches the specified regular expression.
Addresses commonly have the form <user@host.doma.in>.
.It envrcpt <address>
Reject the mail if the sender supplied envelope RCPT TO
address matches the specified regular expression.
.It header <name> <value>
Reject the mail if a header matches the specified name and value.
For instance, the header "Subject: Test" matches name Subject
and value Test.
.It body <line>
Reject the mail if a body line matches the specified regular
expression.
.It macro <name> <value>
Reject the mail if a sendmail macro value matches.
.El
.Pp
The plugin regularly checks the configuration file for modification
and reloads it automatically.
Signals like SIGHUP will terminate the plugin, according
to the milter signal handler.
The plugin reacts to any kind of error, like syntax errors in the
configuration file, by failing open, accepting all messages.
When the plugin is not running,
.Xr sendmail 8
will accept all messages.
.Pp
To use the keyword 'country', prepare IP address allocation lists,
and a few settings must be specified.
.br
Specifying both ipv4file and ipv6file enables GeoIP.
.Bd -literal
The RIR's address allocation list is available as follows;
ftp://ftp.afrinic.net/pub/stats/afrinic/delegated-afrinic-latest
ftp://ftp.apnic.net/pub/stats/apnic/delegated-apnic-latest
ftp://ftp.arin.net/pub/stats/arin/delegated-arin-extended-latest
ftp://ftp.lacnic.net/pub/stats/lacnic/delegated-lacnic-latest
ftp://ftp.ripe.net/pub/stats/ripencc/delegated-ripencc-latest
.Ed
.Pp
Before use the lists, the files must be converted from ASCII format
to binary format using the milter-regex-ip-prep standalone utility
included in the milter-regex package.
.br
cat delegated-*-latest | grep '|..|ipv[46]|' | sort -t '|' -k 3,4 | /install-path/milter-regex-ip-prep ipv4.dat ipv6.dat
.Bl -tag -width "xxxx"
.It ipv4file <file>
Specify the file path of the IPv4 address allocation list.
.br
Maximum path length is 1023 characters.
.It ipv6file <file>
Specify the file path of the IPv6 address allocation list.
.br
Maximum path length is 1023 characters.
.It geoipCashMax <memory>
Maximum size of GEOIP cash memory. Minimum size is 100K.
.br
K and M can be specified as the unit.
.br
Default: 100K
.It geoipCashKeep <period>
Validity of GEOIP cash memory.
.br
H for hours and D for days can be specified as the unit.
.br
Default: 7D
.It geoipDebugLog <level>
For development purpose, this keyword can force syslog level LOG_DEBUG to LOG_INFO.
Only enable syslog output in GEOIP source code, not whole milter-regex.
.br
Values:  DEBUG | INFO
.br
Default: DEBUG
.El
.Pp
.Sh REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
The regular expressions used in the configuration rules are
enclosed in arbitrary delimiters, no further escaping is needed.
.Pp
The first character of an argument is taken as the delimiter,
and all subsequent characters up to the next occurance of the
same delimiter are taken literally as the regular expression.
Since the delimiter itself cannot be part of the regular
expression (no escaping is supported), a delimiter must be
chosen that doesn't occur in the regular expression itself.
Each argument can use a different delimiter, all characters
except spaces and tabs are valid.
.Pp
Two immediately adjacent delimiters form an empty regular
expression, which always matches and requires no
.Xr regexec 3
call.
This can be used in rules requiring multiple arguments, to
match only some arguments.
.Pp
See
.Xr re_format 7
for a detailed description of basic and extended regular expressions.
.Pp
Optionally, the following flags can be used after the closing
delimiter:
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -compact
.It e
Extended regular expression.
This sets REG_EXTENDED for
.Xr regcomp 3 .
.It i
Ignore upper/lower case.
This sets REG_ICASE.
.It n
Not matching.
Reverses the matching result, i.e. the mail is rejected if the
regular expression does not match.
.El
.Sh BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS
A rule can consist of either a simple term or more complex
expressions.
A term has the form
.Bd -literal
header /From/ /domain/i
.Ed
.Pp
and expressions can be built combining terms with operators
"and", "or", "not" and parentheses, as in
.Bd -literal
header /From/ /domain/i and body /money/
( not header /From/ /domain/ ) and ( body /sex/ or body /fast/ )
.Ed
.Pp
Operator precedence should not be relied on, instead parentheses
should be used to resolve any ambiguities (they usually produce
syntax errors from the parser).
.Sh MACROS
Macros allow to store terms or expressions as a name, and $name
can be used as term within other rules, expressions or macro
definitions.
Example:
.Bd -literal
friends         = header /^Received$/ /^from [^ ]*(ork\.net|home\.com)/e
attachments     = header ,^Content-Type$, ,multipart/mixed, and \\
                    body ,^Content-Type: application/,
executables     = $attachments and body ,name=".*\.(pif|exe|scr)"$,e

reject "executable attachment from non-friends"
$executables and not $friends
.Ed
.Pp
Macro names must begin with a letter and may contain alphanumeric
characters and punctuation characters.
Reserved keywords (like "reject" or "header") cannot be used as
macro names.
Macros must be defined before use, the definition must precede the
use in the configuration file, read from top to bottom.
.Sh EVALUATION
Rules are evaluated in the order specified in the configuration
file, from top to bottom.
When a rule matches, the corresponding action is taken, that is
the last action specified before the matching rule.
.Pp
The plugin evaluates the rules every time a line of mail (or
envelope) is received.
As soon as a rule matches, the action is taken immediately,
possibly before the entire mail is received, even if further
lines might possibly make other rules match, too.
This means the first rule matching chronologically has precedence.
.Pp
If evaluation for a line of mail makes two (or more) rules match,
the rule that comes first in the configuration file has precedence.
.Pp
Boolean expressions are short-circuit evaluated, that means
"a or b" becomes true as soon as one of the terms is true and
"a and b" becomes false as soon as one of the terms is false,
even if the other term is not known, possibly because the relevant
mail line has not been received yet.
